// Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.
// Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first  letters of Lilah's infinite string.
// For example, if the string s = 'abcac' and n = 10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first  characters of her infinite string.There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

// Complete the repeatedString function below.
